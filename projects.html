                    <p>This is a mock of the API developer documentation site that I've been building. It uses a CDN called "RapiDoc" to generate the swagger UI based on json files. These json files contain the schema that make up the structure of what you see as well as the individual object descriptions. This site does not have clearance to run test calls, but with the correct credentials and server side clearance that sandbox feature would be enabled.</p>
                    <p>I'm not a professional designer or developer, but those resources have not been made available to me, so I built the entire site by hand. I've been promised additional resources after the customer beta trials are complete. All object descriptions were created by me or created under my supervision.</p>

                <p>This is an HTML export of a set of documentation that was originally created in Notion. It is intended as a reference for other technical writers to use when updating API documentation. The documentation assumes that technical writers are not familiar with technologies like GIT, command line OSs, and other more developer-oriented technologies that are required for these processes.</p>

                <p>This is a section of the Workfront API Documentation site that was designated to familiarize Wrokfront Administrators and non-professional developers with basic API principles. All content, site design, layout, formatting, etc. were created by me using HTML, CSS, and JS. Note that external links to Workfront properties have been disabled. The link to the Dev-doc home site is also currently disabled.</p>
